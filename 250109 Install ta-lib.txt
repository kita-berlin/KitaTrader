1. ta-lib must be in c:\ta-lib prior to run pip3 install TA-Lib
   Especially, there must be a ta-lib.lib in C:\ta-lib\c\lib

2. Installing ta-lib from here does have a ta-lib.lib in C:\ta-lib\c\lib
   however, this does not work since there will be unresolved externals
   https://ta-lib.org/install/#windows

3. This will work: 
   Load https://sourceforge.net/projects/ta-lib/files/ta-lib/0.4.0/ta-lib-0.4.0-msvc.zip

4. Unzip it in C:\ta-lib

5. Open a x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2xxx 

6. Navigate to C:\ta-lib\c\make\csr\win32\msvc
   csr stands for Single thread, see in the README.TXT:
     CSR - Single thread
     CMR - Multi  thread
     CSD - Single thread with debug options
     CMD - Multi  thread with debug options
     CSP - Single thread with profiling options
     CMP - Multi  thread with profiling options
     CDR - DLL Release (Win32 only)
     CDD - DLL Debug (Win32 only)

7 . Run nmake

8. Navigate to C:\ta-lib\c\lib and rename the generated ta_libc_csr.lib to ta-lib.lib

9. run pip3 install TA-Lib

10. Halleluja!
