1. Code Layout:
   •	Indentation: Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
   •	Maximum Line Length: 115 characters
   •	Blank Lines: Use blank lines to separate functions, classes, and blocks of code within functions.
   •	Using Black (Hotkey ^K^D) to beautify the code.

2. Naming Conventions:
   •	Variables and Functions: snake_case.
   •	Classes: PascalCase (CamelCase).
   •	Enums and their members: PascalCase (CamelCase).
   •	Constants: UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES.
   •	Abstract classes start with an I as Interface.
   •	class-internal (local) methods start with an underscore.

3. Imports:
   •	Place imports at the top of the file.
   •	Group imports into three categories:
   1.	Standard library imports.
   2.	Third-party library imports.
   3.	Local application/library imports.

4. Whitespace:
   •	Avoid extraneous whitespace in expressions and statements.
   •	Use a single space around operators and after commas but not inside parentheses.

5. Comments:
   •	Write comments that are clear, concise, and relevant.
   •	Use docstrings for documenting public modules, classes, and functions.

6. String Quotes:
   •	Use double quotes consistently within a project.

7. Exceptions:
   •	Use try-except blocks for handling exceptions.

8. Miscellaneous:
   •	Use descriptive variable names.
   •	Avoid mutable default arguments in functions.
   •	Type checking in Visual Studio must be set to "strict" (Options/Python/Analysis)

9. Use a Python virtual environment named "env" and use the requirements.txt file to install the required packages.
   "env" is git-ignored.
